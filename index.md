I'm Jinhao Hu, aka HuSharp\*, Hu#\*.

I am a first year PhD student at [MPI-SWS](https://mpi-sws.org/) under the supervision of [Prof. Laurent Bindschaedler](https://binds.ch/).

I'm interested in various fields including but not limited to: distributed system, database, and operating system. Previously I am employed at [PingCAP](https://en.pingcap.com) as a Distributed Database Engineer.

I'm a lifelong learner. This site exists to document my past and accompany me on the journey forward.
