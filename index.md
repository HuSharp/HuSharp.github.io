I'm Jinhao Hu, aka HuSharp\*, Hu#\*.

I code with joy and I am interested in various fields including but not limited to: distributed systems, databases, and operating systems.

Currently employed at [PingCAP](https://en.pingcap.com).

I'm a lifelong learner. This site exists to document my past and accompany me on the journey forward.
